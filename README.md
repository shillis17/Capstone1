## Steam Game Genre Analysis

### Description

	I have chosen to research the profitability of different genres of the games on the popular gaming platform Steam. The reason that I have chosen to do this research is that lately the majority of large title games that have been released have fallen under the genres of action or adventure. This research is based on the question, are these genres more inclined to make more money than the other genres?

### Process

	To begin my project I looked for a suitable data set that contains the information that I require, this information is the title of each game, genre(s), number of owners, number of players, and the cost of each game.

From this information I am able to use the sample to estimate the amount of ‘player drop-off’ or players that own the game but no longer play the game, revenue from the game based on sales and price points of the game.

The data set that I found and used for my project is called [Steam Game Data](https://data.world/craigkelly/steam-game-data) from data.world.
