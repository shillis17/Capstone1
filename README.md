## Steam Game Genre Analysis

### Description

I have chosen to research the profitability of different genres of the games on the popular gaming platform Steam. The reason that I have chosen to do this research is that lately the majority of large title games that have been released have fallen under the genres of action or adventure. This research is based on the question, are these genres more inclined to make more money than the other genres?

### Process

To begin my project I looked for a suitable data set that contains the information that I require, this information is the title of each game, genre(s), number of owners, number of players, and the cost of each game.

From this information I am able to use the sample to estimate the amount of ‘player drop-off’ or players that own the game but no longer play the game, revenue from the game based on sales and price points of the game.

The data set that I found and used for my project is called [Steam Game Data](https://data.world/craigkelly/steam-game-data) from data.world. Using this data-set I first put the data into a Pandas data-frame so that I can get familiar with my data and see if there is any data in the data-frame that is irrelevant to my project objective. During this step I found that there were many columns that are not useful for my objective. After trimming the extraneous data from my data-frame I began to graph my results.

### Visualization
	These graphs were constructed using Python’s MatPlotLib library.

The first step was to see the portions of genres that my data included to do this I constructed a bar graph and a pie chart to easily see the proportions of each genre.

From these graphs we can see that the Indie genre has the most games in it, however all the games in the indie genre are also in other genres (most games have more than just one genre) and the only requirement to be in the Indie genre is the game was made by an independent game developer I made the same proportion visualization graphs without the Indie genre showing a more accurate display of the proportions of the game genres.

From here it is easier to see that the genres Action, Adventure, and Casual contain the most games in this data-set. These simple graphs highlight the saturation of games in the Action and Adventure genres that was stated in my question.
From here I wanted to see more about the specific details in each genre. The first step was to find the costs of games in each genre. The next graph visualizes the cost of all games belonging to each genre.

However there is very little use to the total cost of each genre as some genres contain many more games the smaller genres. The next visualization uses the mean cost for each game to account for the size gap in each of the genres to get a better understanding of the per game cost for the consumer of each genre.

What stands out the most to me from this last graph is the fact the the Action and Adventure genres were not the top average cost, but are more towards the bottom end despite being in the top 3 cost total for the genres.

From this point I wanted to find the revenue generated by each of the games, the first step to this is to analyze the amount of people that purchased each of the games.

From this visualization I was able to see that the action genre has almost more than two times the amount of sales of any of the other categories. After using the information from the previous graphs plotted the estimated revenue for each of the genres based on the sale price of the games multiplied by the number of purchases for each game.

Unsurprisingly the graph does not appear to have changed much from the previous one,  since the genres that contain more games have made more revenue. To combat this I wanted to find the average revenue per game for the genres to make a more fair comparison, as the objective for my research is do certain genres make more money per game than others.
